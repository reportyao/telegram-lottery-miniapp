Developing a Cultural Model to Support Web Site Localization: A 
Case Study of Uzbek School Web Sites 
Kathleen F. Gygi and Jan H. Spyridakis  
 
This paper present s the resul ts of a research st udy i n 
which we developed a cultural model and applied it to a 
content/feature analysis of Uzbek secondary school Web 
sites. Our assumpt ion w as that Web si tes desi gned by 
local producers fo r local users wo uld exhibit identifiable 
cultural dimensi ons. We f ound t hat the anal yzed si tes 
followed a general  design template and exhi bited many 
identifiable cultural markers: e.g ., a focus on institutions, 
images of  authority, a lot of blue col oring. Thi s study can 
serve as a met hodol ogical guide for techni cal 
commu nicators interested  in localizing Web  sites o r in 
developing appropriate cultural models in untested 
domains and countries. We identify some key challenges 
in using such methods in unfamiliar, cross-national, and 
cross-cu ltural settin gs. 
 
This report  present s a study in which we devel oped a 
cultural m odel and then used it in evaluating cultural 
preferences in W eb site design, specifically Uzbek 
secondary  school  Web sites. Thi s research was 
conduct ed as part  of an ongoi ng st udy about  the effect s 
of the adopt ion of i nform ation technol ogy on soci ety 
conduct ed by the Central Asia+Inform ation and 
Communication Technol ogies (C AICT) project1 at the 
University of W ashington.  
 
Our goals were to : 
• Devel op a cul turally appropri ate model for 
identifying W eb content/features that reflect 
Uzbek cultural preferences. 
• Anal yze Uzbek school  Web sites to test and 
refin e this model.  
• Discuss chal lenges i n devel oping a cul tural model 
in unfamiliar, cro ss-national and cross-cu ltural 
settin gs. 
• Make recom mendations for t echni cal 
communicators who wi sh to employ cultural 
models to evaluate W eb sites.

about  the CAICT project , see 
http://depts.wash ington.edu/caict/. A significant body  of research has exam ined the role 
national culture plays in how i nternational users percei ve 
and use W eb sites. Thi s research has l ed to the 
devel opment of gui delines for l ocalizing W eb sites. 
Successful  appl ication of such gui delines hinges on 
choosi ng an appropri ate cultural model for a gi ven 
audience or, i n many cases, a nat ion. Hoft  (1) suggest s 
that a devel oper choose an avai lable model and st ick 
with it. Such an approach was i mpossi ble in our work 
because no m odel has been de veloped for/or applied in 
Central Asia.  
 
Thus, we had t o devel op our  own cul tural model and we 
used a hy brid approach:  first devel oping a heuri stic 
cultural model based on avai lable val ues and 
demographi c dat a, and t hen testing that model by 
perform ing a cont ent/feature anal ysis of school  Web 
sites. Our assum ption was t hat Web sites desi gned by  
local producers for l ocal users woul d em body  and 
exhibit identifiab le cultural m arkers. W e also 
invest igated whet her language serves as a cul tural 
marker in this context, i.e., wh ether site d evelopers were 
using Uzbek m ore oft en than Russian or Engl ish. 
 
LITERA TURE REVIEW 
There i s extensive research on t he desi gn and use of W eb 
sites in  cross-cu ltural co ntexts that offers p otential 
cultural models and di mensions t o use i n an anal ysis 
such as this one (e.g., 1, 2, 3). Most of these studies use 
cultural classification schem es devel oped by  Hall (4, 5) 
and/or Hofst ede (6, 7).  
 
Hall (4, 5) descri bes cul ture as a com munication sy stem 
that relates to the am ount of inform ation that a message 
states v ersus what is left im plied in the context 
surroundi ng a m essage. In l ow cont ext cultures (e.g., 
United States), a m essage clearly states all relevant 
inform ation; in high cont ext cultures (e.g., Japan and 
Native Am erican tribes), a message m ay leave m uch to 
be inferred  from the context. Hall co ined the term s 
monochroni c and pol ychroni c to descri be cont rasting 
views of t ime in different  cultures. M onochroni c time 
(characteristic o f the Un ited States) u nfolds sequentially; 
it is simultaneous and l inear. M onochroni c cul tures have 
a preference for schedul es and prom ptness. Pol ychroni c 
time (characteristic of Middle Eastern, Latin Am erican, 
and traditional trib al cu ltures) co nsists o f multiple ev ents

that occur sim ultaneously. Po lychronic cultures ten d to 
be m ore traditional and l ess ori ented to notions of 
progress and t he future. 
 
With a similar goal  as Hal l, Hofst ede (6, 7) devel oped a 
cultural model that includes rat ings of num erous 
count ries on fi ve cul tural dimensions: power di stance, 
individualism/collectiv ism, masculine/fem inine, 
uncert ainty avoi dance, and l ong-t erm orientation. For 
exam ple, he defi nes power di stance as “t he degree of 
equality, or inequality, between  people in the country’s 
society. A hi gh power di stance ranki ng indicates that 
inequalities o f power an d wealth  have been allowed to 
grow with in the society.”2 Latin Am erican and Arab 
nations rank t he highest  in this category ; Scandi navian 
and Germ anic speaki ng count ries the lowest.  
 
Zahedi , Van Pel t, and Song (3 ) and ot hers have t aken 
these indices of cul tural values and m ade predi ctions 
about  their impact on the effect iveness of W eb 
docum ents. They  propose t hat Web docum ents for hi gh 
power distance cu ltures will b e most effectiv e if th ey 
refer t o authority, power, expert ise, and weal th. In a 
similar vein, Marcus and Goul d (2) recom mend that Web 
sites fo r high context cultures co ntain multiple im ages, 
Flash  featu res, an d multiple lin ks.  
 
Unfort unately, none of t he research ci ted here has 
examined cultural dimensions in Central Asia. 
Furtherm ore, t he predi ctions and recom mendations 
offered by  the exi sting m odels can seem  cont radictory. 
Researchers such as Zahir, Dobing, and Hunter (8) cite a 
trend t owards convergence wi th Western desi gn and 
content models on the part  of non-W estern si te producers 
(e.g., Yahoo i s cited as a st andard for nat ional portal 
sites). Johnst on and Johal  (9) cl aim the Web is a virtual 
count ry with its own cul ture.  
 
However, the em pirical research to back up these 
predi ctions and recom mendations i s limited. St. Am ant 
(10) ci tes two approaches t o analyzing W eb sites that are 
devel oped by  members of a speci fic cul ture for m embers 
of their culture: observi ng peopl e (or i nterviewing them) 
or anal yzing W eb sites. Relying on prot otype theory, 
which assu mes that visual featu res on the site will 
exhibit cultural ten dencies, h e reco mmends the latter 
approach. He st arts with one site and then exam ines 
others t o test and refi ne the prot otype in order t o produce 
a checklist for W eb designers for that culture.  
Anot her approach t o devel oping a cul tural model is to 
use nat ional language as a cul tural marker. Al though t his 
approach can be problem atic, especially in a m ultilingual

operat ionalizing cul ture when st udying W eb sites. 
CAICT researchers have i nvest igated the relationshi p 
between l anguage and Int ernet use and found t hat most 
Uzbeks use R ussian on t he Web (11) but  that Engl ish 
language use i s a robust  predi ctor of Int ernet use (12). 
Although Uzbek i s the offi cial language of t he count ry, 
Russian rem ains the language of choi ce for t he 
intellig entsia an d other elites.

METHODOLOGY 
Model Development 
The first step in this study was to create an Uzbek 
cultural model, using Hal l and Hofst ede’s (4, 5, 6, 7) 
dimensions, t hat fits what  we have l earned about  Uzbek 
culture. Research ers an d practitio ners interested  in 
devel oping cul ture/country speci fic models need t o 
locate recent and com prehensive sources for 
demographi c dat a and i nform ation on cul tural values and 
attitu des. Fo r example, the Mich igan World Valu es 
Survey  has ext ensive dat a on m any count ries but  not 
Uzbeki stan.3 Fortunately, we found a recent countrywide 
survey by Dad abaev (15) during our literatu re rev iew. 
 
Uzbekistan is a m ulticultural and m ultilingual country. 
Based on his recent survey of 800 people in seven 
regions i n Uzbeki stan, Dadabaev (15) concl udes t hat 
ethnicity, reg ionalism, and localism  are th e main forms 
of societal self-identifica tion. He found that traditional 
institutions such as th e mahal la (local neighborhood 
community) and fam ily and et hnic traditions are very  
strong even t hough m odern val ues are t aking hol d in the 
cities. Dad abaev points out that these trad itions survived 
extrem e authoritarian Soviet rule with  an Uzb ek set o f 
morals an d educatio n existing in parallel. Sin ce th ese 
same traditions and institutions have survived centuries 
of occupat ion and col onization, it is reasonabl e to 
concl ude t hat Uzbek cul ture is high cont ext and 
polychroni c in Hall’s terms.

Using Hofst ede’s di mensions, Uzbeki stan coul d be 
characterized as:  
• High on the power distance scale.  
• Medium to high on t he masculine scal e.  
• High on the collectivism  scale.  
• Medium to high on t he uncert ainty avoi dance 
scale. 
• High on t he long-t erm orientation scal e.  
 
The st udies revi ewed here woul d predi ct that Web sites 
in our sam ple woul d cont ain the following 
characteristics.  
• Multiple languages, particularly Uzbek and 
Russian, wi th som e Engl ish pages. 
• Multiple im ages featu ring institutions, officials, 
teachers, logos, flags, and national icons. 
• Content, pictures and i mage colors referring to 
Uzbek t raditions or cul ture. 
• Multiple lin ks. 
 
We must point out that the existing literatu re that led  to 
these predictions creates som e contradictions. Research 
such as t hat conduct ed by Zahi r, Dobri ng, and Hunt er (8) 
suggest s that anal ysis of the school  Web sites woul d 
show si tes conform ing to Western (i .e., Uni ted States) 
design and cont ent standards. Hence, t he current  study is 
by necessi ty an expl oratory study.  
Content/Feature Analysis 
One of t he aut hors archi ved 60 Uzbek school  Web sites 
coveri ng five geographi cal regions i n Apri l 2005 and 
February  2006.4 These si tes, including the seven school  
sites u sed for detailed  analysis in  the current study, were 
located through l inks from  the educat ional portal site 
associated with the Global Connect ions and Exchange-
Uzbeki stan (GC&E) project  (www.connect .uz, see 
Figure 1). GC &E school s were oft en the onl y locations 
in many com munities that had Internet access (17).  
 
In the current study, we an alyzed sites produced by 
Uzbeks i n Uzbeki stan for seven school s in two regi ons 
of the count ry (for l anguage choi ce, we anal yzed al l 60 
sites). The W eb sites are i n three di fferent  languages and 
reflect the different  types of school s and professi onal 
cultures at those schools (e .g., Lycee, boarding, or 
Russian school ). 
An underst anding of how t he sites evol ved i s 
inform ative. GC&E hired site m onitors at each school 
and t rained t hem in basic Web desi gn. These advi sors 
helped form  and advi se W eb clubs at  the school s. At  
                                                 
4 In 2001 t here were 9,802 secondary  school s (grade 1-
11) in Uzbeki stan wi th 436,300 st udent s (16). some school s, advi sors coul d not  invest  this level of 
effort  and si tes stagnat ed.5

Most Web sites in Uzbeki stan are not  highly devel oped 
and are oft en not  updat ed. Part  of the impetus for 
studying Uzbek school  Web sites is that these si tes form  
an identifiable, diverse, and com prehensi ve sam ple 
fram e. The fact  that they are al l secondary  school s 
allows us t o cont rol for confoundi ng effect s of genre.  
 
Our analysis fo llows a q ualitativ e, interpretive approach 
to cont ent/feature anal ysis as descri bed by  Jankowski  
and Van Sel m (18) and Jackson (19). Once dat a were 
captured, a prel iminary codi ng fram ework was 
devel oped based on research about  cultural anal ysis of 
Web sites. Two CAICT research assistants coded the 
seven school  Web sites using this fram ework’s broad 
categori es of l anguage, versi ons, t ext, images, and 
colors.6 The coders were work ed with the archived 
(2/27/06) hom e pages.  
 
Part of the purpose of t his study was t o identify 
appropri ate categori es and t echni ques for codi ng this 
particular dat a set and si milar Web archi ves given t he 
biases in herent in cross-cu ltural research , as o utlined by 
MacDonal d (20). One coder i s an Uzbek whose fi rst 
language i s Russian, fol lowed by  Engl ish, although she 
speaks and reads Uzbek as wel l. The ot her coder i s an 
American whose fi rst language i s Engl ish but  who i s 
strong i n Russian. The coders coded hal f the sites 
separately, and then com pared and com bined their 
coding for hal f the sites as a check. They agreed a

they focused on col lecting descri ptive inform ation and

as wel l as on reconci ling ques tions about  translations.  
RESUL TS 
Although t he sites vary  in terms of sophi stication of 
design and W eb technol ogies em ployed, we di d identify 
the following general patterns: 
• Sites seem  to follow a g eneral design template. 
• Half o f the sites are in  Uzb ek, half in Russian , but 
there is significant regional variation in language 
choice.  
• Sites fo cus on institutions (versus people or 
individuals): logos and i mages feat ure aut hority 
figures.  
• The col or blue predom inates, whi ch might reflect 
its national and hi storical significance.  
• Some regions have ext ensive interlinking 
between school  sites.  
• The portal site co mplies with  Marcu s and Gould’s 
(2) gui delines for hi gh cont ext cultures.  
 
Design Template.  The sites seem  to follow a g eneral 
design template with a picture/collage banner across t he 
top of t he page and a com mon set  of links i n the left 
hand navi gation bar (see Fi gure 2). Thi s is to be 
expect ed gi ven t hat the site producers were t rained by  
US project  staff. The port al site, created by W esterners, 
does not  follow the standard Yahoo m odel (as woul d be 
predi cted by Zahi r, Dobri ng and Hunt er) (8). R ather it 
seem s to follow the guidelines outlined by Marcu s and 
Gould (2) for high context cultures: m ultiple im ages, 
Flash  featu res, an d multiple lin ks, except for the high 
degree of axi al symmetry, which is indicative of hi gh 
power distance rather than high context. 
 
Language Choice and Versions.  Of th e 60 sites 
exam ined, exactly half are in Uzbek and hal f are i n 
Russia, yet th ere is sig nifican t regional variatio n in 
choice of l anguage. In our subsam ple, two sites are i n 
Uzbek and fi ve are i n Russian, results that differ from  
the aggregate preference for Uzbek over R ussian in these 
two regi ons. Two have Engl ish versi ons or subsect ions 
on their sites. There are ofte n differences i n the primary 
language versi on (R ussian or Uzbek) and Engl ish 
versi ons, i ncluding di fferent  cont ent and i mages (see 
Figures 3 and 4).

General ly the Engl ish versi ons (see Fi gure 3) are l imited 
to a page or two rather than replicatin g the entire site. 
The R ussian/Uzbek pages (see Fi gure 4) oft en have m ore 
internal lin ks such as “W rite to  Us”; th e English version 
might have m ore recent news item s as well as additional 
external links, for exam ple, to the nat ional school  
Internet festiv al or to an online forum . Differences in 
content and features in these versions raise issues 
regardi ng audi ence.  
 
Interestin gly, the site statistics rep ort indicates th e 
majority o f visitors to the portal site are fro m the Un ited 
States, followed by the European Union.7 The m ost often 
visited pages are forum s, whi ch are conduct ed in 
multiple languages. Most teachers and students from  
Western count ries woul d not  be abl e to read t he school  
Web sites from  their part ner school s. However, t he 
project  pages generat ed by these part nershi ps are oft en in 
Engl ish, or i n Russian (in the case of part ner school s in 
Russia), and can be hard t o find (see Fi gure 5). 
 
Institutio nal Focus.  The school  Web sites’ focus on 
institutions is not surprising given the genre. Th e typ e of 
images vari ed, wi th phot ographs, cart oon i mages, and 
logos feat ured i n many sites. However, as our m odel 
predi cts, even i f peopl e are present  in phot os on t he site, 
they are depicted as m embers of the collective rather 
than as individuals. Authority  figures such as teachers 
and adm inistrators (see Fi gure 6) appear m ore frequent ly 
than student s (except  when st udent s appear i n groups). 
 
Colors.  Blue seem s to be a dominant color in this 
subsam ple, used i n five of seven si tes (see Fi gures 1-3 
and 5). Som e sites are very  blue. Tradi tional colors used 
in national designs are bl ue and whi te. Since t hese col ors 
are al so m ourni ng col ors, gol d or si lver are added t o 
make the color schem es shiny.8 At least o ne site, wh ich 
was very  green and y ellow (see Figure 6), reflected its 
school  colors, whi ch were di scussed under t he 
“Inform ation About  the School ” link. 
 
Links.  A quick review of the sites for the entire 60 
school s showed t hat in som e regions al l the school s link 
to each other. This practice is suggestive given that a 
study of activ ity on the portal site sh ows that these 
school s are worki ng together on GC &E project s such as 
curri culum devel opment. External links on t he school  
sites are l imited primarily to the port al and sponsor si tes. 
One school  was except ional in the num ber of ext ernal 
links t o regional school s and Am erican part ners, a 
pattern that co nfirms the high context/collectiv ist 
dimensions of t his study’s model (see Fi gure 5). In fact ,

DISCUSSION 
The presence of features such as im ages and links 
follows the predi ctions of t he proposed cul tural model in 
some cases. In other cases the results are contradictory, 
as we expect ed. Anal ysis of addi tional Web sites woul d 
allow us to further test an d refine our m odel. However, 
given the multiple cu ltures th at might be at play here—
ethnic, reg ional/local, p ost-Soviet, in stitutional—th e 
model is by necessi ty very  general . Nevert heless, the 
categori es do gi ve anal ysts a com mon vocabul ary to 
descri be the findings. Gi ven the results discussed here, 
we are now abl e to make prel iminary recom mendations 
about  designing appropri ate Web sites for Uzbek 
audiences and for ot her audi ences that m ight fit the 
Copy right 2007 

cultural model we devel oped. In t hat these 
recom mendations are bey ond t he scope of t his paper, 
they are not  discussed here. 
 
At this point we cannot  answer t he quest ion about  
convergence wi th Western m odels. The si tes follow a 
general design template an d focus on institutions. These 
charact eristics coul d be due t o the com mon training of 
the producers (by W esterners) as well as the site’s genre. 
However, t his apparent  standardi zation coul d also be a 
sign of convergence. For exam ple, the frequent  use of 
the col or blue coul d refl ect expressi on of nat ional or 
ethnic identity g iven its h istorical sig nifican ce as a 
traditional color and its p resence in  the national flag .  
 
Differences i n the Russian and Engl ish versi ons of t he 
sites raise issues about  audi ence t hat bear furt her 
invest igation through cont ent and di scourse anal ysis. 
Anot her frui tful avenue of i nquiry woul d focus on t he 
external linking pract ices of t he school s and how t hey 
relate to  intended audience. In terviews with  site 
producers wo uld help illuminate some of these issu es. 
APPLICA TIONS FOR TC 
PROFESSIONALS 
When desi gning a W eb site for i nternational or cross-
cultural audiences, technical communicators need to be 
cogni zant of the fact  that differences i n culture may 
impact the way the site is perceived and used by specific 
audiences. Cu ltural differen ces can  be subtle but still 
have m ajor impacts. Em ploying an appropri ate cultural 
model can be ext remely useful  if one i s avai lable. If not , 
the desi gner or ot her localization professi onal may have 
to devel op a m odel. 
 
To identify an  appropriate m odel, tech nical 
communicators should fam iliarize them selves with 
foundat ional works on cul ture such as Hal l (4, 5) and 
Hofst ede (6, 7). Techni cal com municators shoul d also 
review research rel ating to guidelines and desi gn 
principles for cul ture-appropri ate Web desi gn (e.g., 1, 2, 
3, 8, 14). If t hey cannot  find a readi ly appl icable model, 
they must then devel op their own.  
 
Based on our pi lot study, we recom mend taking the 
following steps: 
1. Locate recent local dem ographic and social 
values dat a. 
2. Identify k ey cultural dimensions and rate th em 
per Hal l and Hofst ede. 
3. Consult with  experts on the culture of interest as 
well as lo cal in formants. 
4. Confirm or refi ne your draft  model. 5. Test your m odel using act ual Web sites creat ed 
by local producers. 
a. Select a well-d efined sample of sites th at 
controls for genre. 
b. Perform  a content/feature analysis using 
an est ablished m ethodol ogy. 
c. Interview site p roducers if p ossible. 
d. Interpret y our results. 
6. Refine your m odel based on y our anal ysis. 
7. Generat e design recom mendations usi ng 
recogni zed gui delines such as t hose offered by  
Goul d and M arcus (2). 
 
Some key chal lenges t o keep i n mind include t he 
following poi nts: 
1. Local  data may not be avai lable at a fine enough 
grain (e.g., dat a may concern al l of C entral Asia 
instead of onl y Uzbek speaki ng regi ons). 
2. Operatio nalizing national culture can  be 
probl ematic, but language can be a useful  proxy . 
3. Transl ation of si tes is a huge effort , requi ring 
considerable hum an and tim e resources, as is the 
content/feature analysis. 
4. Arch iving sites is well wo rth the effo rt; it allo ws 
worki ng wi th sites offl ine without worry ing 
about  havi ng el ements change. 
5. Coders m ust be trained properl y to ensure 
interco der reliab ility. 
 
We believe that technical com municators are well 
positioned t o anal yze the influence of cul ture on W eb
